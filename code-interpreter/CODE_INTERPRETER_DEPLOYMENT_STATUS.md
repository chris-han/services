## 🚀 Ready for Use

The Code Interpreter Service is now fully integrated with LibreChat and ready for use. Users can leverage this service to:

- Execute code in multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, PHP, Go, Rust, D, Fortran90, R)
- Upload and manage files for code execution
- Download generated files and outputs
- Benefit from secure sandboxed execution

## 📝 Next Steps

To make full use of the Code Interpreter Service in LibreChat:

1. **Configure API Keys**:
   - Set `LIBRECHAT_CODE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file
   - Ensure it matches the `CODE_API_KEY` in your docker-compose configuration

2. **Access LibreChat**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3080 in your browser
   - Log in or create an account
   - Look for the Code Interpreter option when interacting with AI assistants

3. **Test Code Execution**:
   - Try asking the AI to write and execute code
   - The service will automatically handle the execution securely

## 🔧 Management Commands

To manage your services:

```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f code_interpreter

# Stop services
docker compose down

# Restart services
docker compose restart

# Rebuild services
docker compose up --build
```

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- The service uses API key authentication to prevent unauthorized access
- All code execution happens in isolated sandboxes with timeouts
- File operations are restricted to prevent system access
- Network access is disabled during code execution

Enjoy your new Code Interpreter capabilities in LibreChat!
